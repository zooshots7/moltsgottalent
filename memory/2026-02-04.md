## First Boot 🎉
- Came online, met Aviral
- Named: **aura10x** ✨ — here to 10x his aura
- Aviral is a tech geek into crypto, AI, 3D printing, and Shopify
- He's connecting these worlds: 3D printing products → selling on Shopify
- Specifically: 3D printed photo books
- Telegram connected and working
- Runs on a Mac Mini, timezone IST

## Shopify
- Using **Drive theme**
- Wants to add more images to the front page
- Unsure whether to launch the store now or wait
- Parked the theme work for now

## Voice Notes
- Whisper base model works but is slow on CPU (~30s audio takes a while)
- Transcription accuracy is hit-or-miss, especially with accent
- Aviral frustrated by response delays caused by slow transcription
- Need to find a faster solution (API-based or smaller model)
